# weather-dashboard - OpenWeather API - JavaScript


## Description

This is a weather deashboard that was designed using semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I implemented the OpenWeather API to grab current, and future forecasts of a desired city!

When the user searches for a city and clicks the search button, the current weather will display in the box directly below. The user will also be given a 5-day forecast for that city!

I implemented local storage to store recently searched cities. The user is able to click on any of these cities, and view its forecast!
